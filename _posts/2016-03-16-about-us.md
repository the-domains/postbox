The sheen and tenor of a piece of audiovisual work is enhanced by good and competent Post Production.

As someone once said, that life is induced into film at the editor's table.

Today Post Production is a fine art, which combines creativity with edgy technology, to bring to life spectacular celluloid creations. At Post Box, you will find a team spearheaded by Surya Kumar,  a FLAME specialist, who works with Ragupathi, the VFX supervisor and Arun Kumar the offline editor.

They come together as a team to transform your story into a perfect piece of cinematic execution.

The Post Box reel tells the story of how you can transform a mere thought into a sensational frame of film.

Post Box has facilities to Edit, render visual effects, Colour Grade, Clean up and render audio and video sync.
